# About this standard
The cXc Music NFT Standard works with the [Atomichub](https://wax.atomichub.io/) and [Neftyblocks](https://neftyblocks.com/) to help any individual, collection, or application to make their own music NFT project. 

This standard is a schema (more recently called "category" on atomichub.io) which allows you to make templates for Music NFTs.

The benefits of using this schema include forward compatibility (Geotags) getting artists plays that pay with traditional platform players, credits, links, and more.

**There's no coding required.** But you'll see the code below ready for changes if you'd rather exclude traditional players, or add extra audio fields. You can even [make a music NFT from your phone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0vt8v5iIn4)

This Schema exists within Atomic Asset's [NFT standard](https://github.com/pinknetworkx/atomicassets-contract) on the [atomicassets contract](https://wax.bloks.io/account/atomicassets).

Feel free to use or modify this schema for any purposes in accordance with the [license](LICENSE).

All other info fields are strings (except "track" is int64)  

`year` is also a string in case there's a more accurate date desired or a range of years.

*Rarity* is filterable on many NFT marketplaces

License is for codes like "CC-BY", or can be used to declare a priviledge granted upon receiving NFT. 



## Geo üåç
ISO country codes should follow ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 (USA, COL, etc)

Locale string intended to be used in this format "City, County, State" or corresponding values for a given locality

# To use the cXc Music NFT Standard 
First, you'll need a collection. 

> If you're new, follow [this guide](https://nftnewstoday.com/2023/04/24/the-ultimate-guide-to-atomichub-nfts-trading-and-more/) for more info.

To add a Music NFT schema to your collection, you may: 

1) Manually re-create the schema from the UI (Remember schema is called 'category' on atomichub) by adding each field in the table above. This is 'the long way'

or, do it almost instantly by: 

2) Copy the code below using the copy icon in the top-right of the code. Paste the following array into the `idata` field using the Atomic Assets [createschema](https://waxblock.io/account/atomicassets?action=createschema#contract-actions) action to create your own schema on Atomic Assets, and then create template from the schema for each NFT you release via Atomichub or Neftyblocks. 

![Example using Waxblock.com](images/example-through-waxblock.png)



> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Important  

Using this schema does NOT mean that each template (or NFT) must have every field filled, but you can only choose from fields in your future templates. You may add fields to the schema later, but not remove them. New fields will appear at the end (ugly), thus, best to modify this standard to your needs before deploying.

# Create a Template  üõ†Ô∏è üñºÔ∏è. 
Once you have your schema in place, use it to drop your own Music NFTs using tools like [Atomichub](https://wax.atomichub.io/) and [Neftyblocks](https://neftyblocks.com/).


# Modify this schema  üõ†Ô∏è

The power is in your hands! You can add, remove, or change fields when making your own schema.

Ideas:

**Artist** - If you'd rather have your name here than in credits   
**Multiple Audio fields** - Duplicate the audio fields to include all songs on an album (DYOR on marketplace support)   
**Metadata** - Add custom metadata like the key, BPM, time, whatever you want   

If you'd rather include all of your links in the Platform field, you can remove the Spotify, Soundcloud, and Youtube field. 

Removing Youtube will also disable Youtube player from showing up on Atomichub and likely other marketplaces.


# Power of the Schema ‚ú® üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Using this template ensures maximum forward-compatibility with [music.cXc.world](https://music.cxc.world)

There is no magical benefit (yet) of using this standard, just practical ones. Youtube plays can bring extra revenue, as will the links to other players. You may credit all involved, and geographic data opens up new use cases for your NFT.  

In the future it's possible a mapp / dapp (like cXc) to allow users to register their own schemas that adhere to this standard, creating a Music-NFT exclusive platform that doesn't rely on accounts or collection names alone. 


# Evolution of the Schema üöÄ üõ∏

This schema will grow and evolve. Feel free to open issues on this repo with your suggestions.  

If you translate to another blockchain or NFT standard, please send a pull request adding a file named <chain>.md in the main directory containing the code needed to deploy, or open an issue with the code and I can update the repo if you prefer. 

# Mini Change Log

## 1.0.0
Changed `year` to `released`
Changed types to better work with atomichub's UI
Improved explanation + added image


## 0.1.4
Added Additional `clip` and img fields
Changed `promo` description to suggest video + image 
Merged Simple version, made Simple the only option. To use old version, change string to string[] and use. This isn't recommended as there's little benefit and it's not working well through the Atomichub website

## 0.1.3
Added `artist`, `year`, and `collectionimg`

## 0.1.2
Added `rarity` and `license`

## 0.1.1
Added `track` and `album`
